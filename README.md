# 🌸 Iris Species Classifier with Django

This project is a web application that uses Machine Learning to predict Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## 🎯 Project Overview
This application integrates a **Machine Learning model** into the **Django** framework. It demonstrates how to handle data input, process it through a trained model, and display predictions in a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Django (Python)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
* **Database:** SQLite (for user and entry management)

## ⚙️ Core Features
* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system.
* **Data Management (CRUD):** Users can add, view, and manage flower data entries.
* **CSV Support:** Functionality to import/export flower data via CSV files.
* **Real-time Prediction:** Instant classification using a pre-trained ML model.

## 👥 Collaborative Work
This was a group project developed by 4 members. I specifically focused on:
* Developing the Django backend architecture.
* Implementing the CSV import/export logic.
* Integrating the ML model into the web views.
